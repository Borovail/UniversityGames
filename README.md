# UniversityGames
A collection of small games developed as part of university assignments. Both games are written in C as required by the assignments.

## CosmicRanger
This game was developed personally by me. It includes comprehensive documentation that explains how to run and play the game.

## SnowMania
I developed this game for another student in exchange for payment. It also comes with detailed documentation on how to set up and play the game.
